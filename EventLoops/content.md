# README - JavaScript Event Loop and Output Explanation

    This README provides an explanation of the output for the JavaScript code snippet you provided. The code contains various asynchronous operations that run within the JavaScript event loop, each with different priorities and execution times. Below is a breakdown of the output you can expect:

    ```javascript
    console.log("A.. sync task");

    requestAnimationFrame(function () {
    console.log("B.. UI");
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("C.. set time out");
    }, 0);

    Promise.resolve()
    .then(function () {
        console.log("E.. micro task");
    })
    .then(function () {
        console.log("F.. micro task");
    });

    console.log("E.. sync task");
    ```

## Output Explanation

1. `console.log("A.. sync task")` - This is a synchronous task and will be the first output to appear in the console.

2. `requestAnimationFrame` - This function is part of the Web API and is used for scheduling animations. The callback function provided to it will be executed before the next repaint, which typically occurs before the next frame is rendered. Therefore, "B.. UI" will be logged after the current frame rendering.

3. `setTimeout` - The setTimeout function schedules a callback function to be executed after a specified delay (in this case, 0 milliseconds). It is placed in the callback queue. However, it doesn't guarantee immediate execution; it will be placed in the queue and executed as soon as the call stack is empty. So, "C.. set time out" will appear after the synchronous tasks but before the microtasks.

4. `Promise.resolve().then(...)` - The code inside the Promise's then method represents microtasks. Microtasks have a higher priority than the callback queue, so they will be executed before the setTimeout callback. Therefore, "E.. micro task" and "F.. micro task" will be logged before "C.. set time out."

5. `console.log("E.. sync task")` - This is another synchronous task and will be logged right after "A.. sync task."

## Final Output Order

    This order explains how different types of JavaScript tasks, such as synchronous tasks, microtasks, and tasks scheduled using requestAnimationFrame and setTimeout, are handled in the event loop, ensuring that asynchronous code executes in a coordinated and predictable manner.

    ```
    A.. sync task
    E.. sync task
    E.. micro task
    F.. micro task
    B.. UI
    C.. set time out
    ```
