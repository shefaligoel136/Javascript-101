When an unused type -> object ,value etc -> they are not in use then
JS's Garbage collector removes it from the memory and frees up the memory for further usage

### Ques How do you define whether a type is unused ->

Mark and sweep algorithm -> identified unused types and then remove them -> if a type is not
referring to any other type/var/ array
